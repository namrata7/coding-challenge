# Craneware Coding Challenge

Set of coding challenges in C# and Java.

### 1. Write a method to reverse a string

In the `ReversingString` project, there is a method called `Reverse` in `StringUtilities` class. Implement this method so that it returns the string in reverse order:

Examples:
```
Input:  "BarBazQux"
Output: "xuQzaBraB"
```

```
Input:  "Hello Foo"
Output: "ooF olleH"
```

### 2. Implement a code to provide and shuffle a pack of cards

Add code to the `CardGame` project. The project already contains contracts (interfaces) that must be implemented. The implementation must contain the following:

- provide a standard pack of 52 cards
- the pack can be randomly shuffled
- a card can be removed from the top of the pack
- all cards are returned to the pack when the pack is shuffled
